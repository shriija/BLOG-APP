# 🚀 BlogApp - Modern Full-Stack MERN Application

BlogApp is a premium, feature-rich blogging platform built with a modern **MERN Stack** (**MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js**). The platform features a stunning glassmorphic UI, secure role-based authentication, responsive layouts, and a scalable backend architecture optimized for performance and maintainability.

The application enables users to explore articles, authors to publish blogs, and administrators to manage platform activity through secure APIs and protected routes.

# 📖 How it Started

The project began with a vision to create a blogging platform that doesn't just work well but also delivers a visually easing experience.

We chose the **MERN stack** because of its flexibility, scalability, and modern development workflow. By leveraging **Vite** for the frontend, we achieved lightning-fast development speed and optimized production builds.

The backend architecture follows a modular structure with separate APIs for:

* Authors
* Users
* Authentication
* Admin Controls

This separation keeps the codebase clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

# 🔒 Authentication Flow

```text id="n7h1w6"
User Login
   ↓
JWT Token Generated
   ↓
Stored in HttpOnly Cookie
   ↓
verifyToken Middleware
   ↓
Protected Routes Access
```

### Why HttpOnly Cookies?

* Prevents XSS attacks
* Tokens inaccessible from frontend JavaScript
* More secure session handling
